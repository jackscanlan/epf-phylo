# fungal-phylo
Phylogenomics pipeline for fungi, including entomopathogenic fungi (EPF)



#### Notes:
- Use UFCG (Java; Docker) for running phylogenomics: https://github.com/steineggerlab/ufcg
- alibaseq (Python) for extracting loci from genomes: https://github.com/AlexKnyshov/alibaseq
  - alternative is phyluce: https://github.com/faircloth-lab/phyluce
- SPAdes for assembling genomes from reads: https://github.com/ablab/spades
